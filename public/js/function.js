/*

Variables come from 2 places:
1)  Function arguments
2)  Newly defined vars


Because we want to track variables (values, dependencies, etc), we'll try to quarantine them on an object.

Function Object:
inputs
	async dependencies
steps

pause/resume/step
before/after hooks


> Encapsulate as much as possible (1-5 line functions)
